               According to the Study material, "Bountiful Foods 
               is small business specializing in organic, locally 
               grown foods. They are physically located in Carlsbad, 
               California, however, they have many food trucks that 
               cover the coastal area from Los Angeles to San Diego. 
               The company sells fruits and produce directly from the 
               farmers in the area, but also uses some national and 
               international suppliers. The owner-operated company 
               caters to walk in traffic at their storefront in 
               Carlsbad and, of course, their food trucks. They 
               deliver and manage those orders on the phone and via 
               the website. The mission is to provide fresh and healthy
               food options, including organic, made to order, fruit 
               drinks and fruit bags, to the local population and to 
               tourists visiting the coastal areas. The theme should 
               support healthy eating, organic bounty, and convenience.."
